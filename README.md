## GT

- Display
  - make different game sprite classes for statics / dynamics
  - FINISH HEALTH
- Behaviors
  - add facing module (abstract?)
- START GOBLIN STATE

  - game sprite container should manage insertion and deletion, given a game system. It should take its cues from the entity it observes. Updateable as a whole.
  - change "factory" to "builder"?

- Physics
  - Make more tests
  - 2nd pass-over
- IDEA (especially for local games): Manage offline map tiles, and feed them into the entity handler as actors get close enough
